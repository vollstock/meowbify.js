# meowbify.js

This is a small javascript that will [meowbify](http://meowbify.com) your site.  
Meowbify needs access to your site so this will of course not work locally.

## Usage

The script relies on JQuery to register keyboard events.
Insert the meowbify script after JQuery:

    <script src="cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="js/meowbify.js"></script>

Type **“meow”** to meowbify your page.
